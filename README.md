# Cryptobook
Centralized Cryptocurrency orderbook from multiple exchanges

# Description
The US stock market is largely centralized.  Most brokers can recieve and send orders from any exchange, making buying or selling stocks at the best price trivial.  In addition, the introduction of legislation such as Regulation NMS allows nearly any participant in the stock market to gain insight into how other participants operate.

In the crypto world, the decentralization means prices can fluctuate wildly from exchange to exchange.  This means that anyone looking to purchase a particular asset may not be recieving the best price.  

This project aims to show a more global orderbook for the cryptocurrency market.  By sourcing the individual orderbooks of many exchanges, we can combine their orders to gain a better view of the type of activity occuring within the wider market.
